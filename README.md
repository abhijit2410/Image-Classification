# Image-Classification

This repository contains an image classification model that uses machine learning algorithms to classify images based on their content. The model is based on a dataset that includes images of various objects and animals.

The project is built using Python programming language and utilizes several libraries, including Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy, and Matplotlib. The dataset used in this project is publicly available and has been preprocessed to ensure its accuracy and completeness.

## Here is the folder structure,

* UI : This contains ui website code
* server: Python flask server
* model: Contains python notebook for model building
* images_dataset: Dataset used for our model training

## Technologies used in this project,

1. Python
2. Numpy and OpenCV for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
6. Python flask for http server
7. HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
